Stage 3. Integration: Statement clearly provides evidence of integration of prior knowledge, feelings, or attitudes with new knowledge, feelings, or attitudes, thus arriving at new perspectives.
Stage 4. Appropriation: Statement clearly shows evidence that inferences have been made using their own prior knowledge and previous experience throughout the task.
Stage 5. Outcomes of Reflection: Statement clearly shows evidence of reflection and clearly states: (1) a change in behaviour or development of new perspectives as a result of the task; (2) ability to reflect on own task, apply new knowledge feelings, thoughts, opinions to enhance new future experiences; and (3) examples.
